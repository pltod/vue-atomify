# Install

Node modules are not committed although some people recommend the opposite in certain cases - http://www.futurealoof.com/posts/nodemodules-in-git.html. So do install them first with: 

> npm install


# Run

Choose one of the possible workflows

> With npm: **npm run serve**

> With gulp: **gulp**


If the browser does not open automatically open it manually at **http://localhost:1337/index.html** to see the running app.


# Credits

This project combines

* Component development with Vue.js presented in:

> https://github.com/vuejs/vue-browserify-example

* Build process with Atomify presented in:

> https://github.com/Techwraith/atomify-example

* **The only new thing is the possibility to build and run the application as part of a gulp workflow.**
